## Contributing

We're hoping to add [environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments), [variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables) and [data visualizations](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/#visualizing-response-data). If you're able to help add any of those, or to improve the Avalanche Postman Collection in any way, first create a feature branch by branching off of `master`, make the improvements on your feature branch and lastly create a [pull request](https://github.com/cgcardona/avalanche-postman-collection/pulls) to merge your work back in to `master`.
